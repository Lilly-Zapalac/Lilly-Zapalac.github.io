Hi, I am a 3rd year Ecosystem Science and Sustainability student with a minor in Environmental Studies in the Liberal Arts. I am interested in water conservation and water law. I also am interested in qualitative analysis, and working with people to hope to find different solutions that can work for different communities. I hope to one day work with marine ecosystems and help with water quality.
